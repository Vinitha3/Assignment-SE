**Project Name : No Poverty** 
A Software Solution to Support Poverty Alleviation

**Problem Statement**

Despite rapid technological advancement, millions still live in poverty, especially in rural and marginalized communities. 
Lack of access to essential resources, education, and employment opportunities perpetuates the poverty cycle. 
A scalable digital solution is needed to bridge this gap, provide access to welfare schemes, skill development, and community resources.

**Objective**

To design and develop a software platform that facilitates access to government welfare schemes, local job opportunities, 
skill training, and community support networks for underprivileged populations.
Scope of the Project
- Targeting low-income or below-poverty-line (BPL) individuals
- Covering rural and semi-urban areas
- User-friendly mobile-first interface (due to low digital literacy)
- Multilingual support
- Integration with existing government welfare APIs (hypothetical)
  
**Key Modules**
1. User Registration
   - Email or Mobile OTP login
   - Profiles for Individuals and NGOs

2. Scheme Discovery & Eligibility Checker
   - Based on demographic data (age, income, region, category)
   - Personalized scheme recommendations

3. Skill Development
   - Curated learning content (videos, PDFs, offline support)
   - Integration with platforms like SWAYAM or Skill India

4. Job Finder
   - Local job listings (semi-skilled/unskilled)
   - Resume builder and simple application flow

5. Community Support & Crowdsourcing
   - NGOs and individuals can post support needs or donations
   - Volunteer management

6. Analytics Dashboard (Admin)
   - Usage stats
   - Impact measurement (registered users, jobs applied, etc.)
     
**Methodology**

Follows Agile Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- Requirement Gathering (via surveys/interviews with NGOs)
- System Design (Use Case Diagrams, DFDs, ER Diagrams)
- Implementation (modular coding with version control)
- Testing (unit, integration, UAT with dummy users)
- Deployment & Feedback (pilot run in simulated environment)
  
**Expected Outcomes**

- A working prototype that empowers users in poverty to access schemes, jobs, and learning resources
- Improved digital inclusion and awareness
- Framework to scale or integrate with government systems
